# Hotel Booking Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of hotel booking data to uncover patterns in cancellations, seasonal trends, and customer demographics.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to answer key questions such as:
- What is the overall cancellation rate?
- Which hotel type (City vs. Resort) has higher cancellations?
- How do cancellations vary by month or country?
- What market segments contribute most to bookings and cancellations?

## Dataset
The dataset `hotel_bookings.csv` contains hotel booking information, including details like booking dates, cancellations, customer demographics, and more.  
**Note:** Ensure the dataset is placed in the project directory. The dataset may be sourced from platforms like Kaggle (e.g., [Hotel Booking Demand Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)).
